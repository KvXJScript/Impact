# Impact

Hello and welcome, 
This is my approach to Impact recruitment task.
This app should run from scratch after installing node_modules with `npm i` and later on just use `npm run dev`

# Improvements
I'd for sure use: 
- Translations for the whole app using i18n as the current standard
- Custom generic hooks for api calls with onSuccess / onError handlers, probably with cached values + preFetching data to make sure the app is as user friendly as possible
- Data fetching into loader helper in react-router dom to make sure it is well optimized
- Better structure of the context for better maintenance of code
- Atomic design, which goes very well with tailwind approach
- Tests in rtl + jest
- Better UX/UI to be more user friendly `for sure mobile needs some improvements`
- Better code structure, which always should be contacted with the team to match one standard

## About features I think the options are not ending story:
- User auth
- Search and Filters
- Product reviews and ratings
- Product recommendations
- Dynamic categories and subcategories
- Futuristic UI/UX, maybe with animations or some cool color combinations 
- Order tracking

And the list goes on...

Probably there is much more that I'd like to change but right now nothing more comes to my mind :D 

Was dope to do this task and to the one reading it, have a nice day!
